## Fork Differentiation Strategy

### What Makes This Fork Special:
1. **Target Audience**: Engineers vs. general developers
2. **Use Case**: Project documentation vs. general web crawling  
3. **Interface**: Interactive CLI vs. Python API
4. **Organization**: Hierarchical projects vs. single files
5. **Output**: AI-enhanced docs with TOC vs. raw content
6. **Workflow**: Windows/VS Code optimized vs. general

### Marketing Message:
"While crawl4ai is an excellent general-purpose web crawling library, Engineering Crawler transforms it into a specialized project management tool for technical professionals who need systematic documentation workflows."
